  			<h1 class="display-4 sm-spacer" id="about-me">Research/Inspiration</h1>
    		<p class="sm-spacer md-font">We started the project by discussing the general feel and theme of the game that we wanted to create. Through our discussions we came to an agreement that we wanted to create a game that was similar
          to Super Mario in terms of it being a 2d side scroller game. The main idea of the game came from a game with a very similar game concept called Cat mario. The game starts the character (cat) in the very first map of super mario.
          Assuming that the player has played that map previously, they will try to traverse through it as normal, but every part of the game has some kind of hidden traps designed to kill the player in very annoying ways.</p>
        <h1 class="display-4 sm-spacer" id="about-me">Themes</h1>
        <p class="sm-spacer md-font">The game follows a farmer that wakes up after being kidnapped by his sheep. He finds himself in an unfamiliar section of his farm
          where he is forced to find his way back home. What he doesn't know is that his sheep have plotting revenge against him, which will force him to face a series of
           traps and obstacles designed to kill him. So far, I think our project has been meeting the absurd part of the game pretty well since it has hidden traps and other mechanics that may seem intuitive for any other game,
           but where in ours it will punish you. </p>

        </div>
        <h1 class="display-4 sm-spacer" id="about-me">Purpose</h1>
        <p class="sm-spacer md-font">The overall purpose of our game is creating a game interface that has the perfect balance between challenging yet, addicting.
          This is so that the player is faced with a difficult game that will take time and enough. We want to make this game difficult, but not enough so that the players
           get frustrated enough to give up and no longer want to play the game. The design of our game follows a basic formula in which following logic and doing things the
           way they should will end up punishing the player by either triggering traps, or other mechanics that will attempt to kill the player.</p>
        <h1 class="display-4 sm-spacer" id="about-me">Project Goals</h1>
        <h3 class="sm-spacer">Game Mechanics</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Sheep Attack: Sheep suddenly appears and instantly kills the farmer.</li>
          <li>Falling floor</li>
          <li>Rolling hay bale</li>
          <li>Pitch fork trap</li>
          <li>Jumping Cow</li>
          <li>Falling Bird</li>
          <li>Invisible Objects</li>
          <li>Setting checkpoints</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="sm-spacer">Stage</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Farm</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="sm-spacer">Game Rules</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>If a players die before a checkpoint, they start from the begining</li>
          <li>If a player dies after a checkpoint, they start from the checkpoint</li>
          <li>If a player hits an enemy, they die</li>
          <li>If the player falls from the map, they die</li>
          <li>Background doesn't scroll to the left (Prevents the player from going back)</li>
          <li>If the player finds the hidden end goal, the game will end.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1 class="display-4 sm-spacer" id="about-me">Reflection</h1>
        <p class="sm-spacer md-font">Some of the obstacles we've faced are that we all barely know how program using unity's most common language C# so it takes quite a while for the objects to act in a way we would
           want to because we would have to watch multiple tutorials and combine what we picked up on it since most video does not give us a perfect code for our absurd trap behavior. We dealt with it by splitting
            roles on which traps we will make so that one people will not have to do all the coding. I think our team has been working pretty well together, and we've been able to meet a lot of the goals and
            mechanics that we wanted to add to our game. In terms of our time management we've done very and we are ahead of our planned schedule which will hopefully give us more time to refine the graphics
             and make the overall game feel more smooth.</p>

        </ul>

        <h3 class="sm-spacer">How was this game absurdist?</h3>
        <h4 class="sm-spacer">Traps/Obstacles</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>There are unforeseen traps and you have to figure out how to avoid them</li>
          <li>Random obstacles</li>
          <li>You do not know where your obstacles are until you die from them.</li>
          <li>This game is absurdist because the obstacles are very random.</li>
          <li>Random obstacles and seems very annoying</li>
          <li>Really hard. traps everywhere.</li>
          <li>It had different traps.</li>
          <li>It is always changing and the traps try to kill you</li>
          <li>Because it frustrates player trying to play the game</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="sm-spacer">Other</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The game is designed to make you fail.</li>
          <li>Because it frustrates player trying to play the game</li>
          <li>I suggested you try to tie it into absurdism more either with narrative themes such as tying it to the Myth of Sisyphus.</li>
          <li>The fact that each move that the player makes is already predetermined and stopped is ridiculous.</li>
          <li>It takes very long, and it switches controls</li>
          <li>Not sure yet. It was ultra difficult in an absurd way</li>
          <li>It's that they made it impossible to move on to the next level</li>
          <li>Unnecessary hard obstacles</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="sm-spacer">What elements do you think could be improved?</h3>
        <h4 class="sm-spacer">Storyline</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Storyline, nothing aside from the gameplay is "absurd."</li>
          <li>Mark's idea of including a narrative</li>
          <li>Make it more absurd with narrative</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="sm-spacer">Length of game</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Making more obstacles and making it longer</li>
          <li>Make the game shorter?</li>
          <li>I think the only thing they need to add is to continue the game longer and adding more.</li>
          <li>More stuff</li>
          <li>Different obstacles</li>
          <li>More traps</li>
          <li>I really want to see this idea pushed further, but pretty awesome how much you've done so far!</li>
          <li>Add complexity and randomness</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="sm-spacer">Make it different from other games</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Just make sure to make it a little different from the Trap 2 game. Like we said in class, maybe add some overarching story line or meta 4th wall break.</li>
          <li>Make it so its different from ones already available online</li>
          <li>Distinguishing it from existing game? I too felt like it was very similar to a game that I saw one of a famous youtuber play.</li>
          <li>It looks like a carbon copy of the other games. Add a new mechanic to make it stand out.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="sm-spacer">Other</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>I think that having someone quit too easily is not fun, make them think theyre gonna win, but make them lose</li>
          <li>I didn't really get the point of the game. Probably to make it a little more clearer.</li>

        <h4 class="sm-spacer">Summary</h4>
        <p>Currently, the impression we got for this game is that it is a 2D platformer that is difficult.
          People who would play it would easily become frustrated by the traps that the player would not expect.
          Our plan is to not be exactly like existing games like Cat mario and Trap Adventure.
          We will design the stage that is unique from those games, and possibly add a story to the game so that it would be more interesting.
