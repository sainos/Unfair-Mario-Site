  			<h1 class="display-4 sm-spacer" id="about-me">Research/Inspiration</h1>
    		<p class="sm-spacer md-font">We started the project by discussing the general feel and theme of the game that we wanted to create. Through our discussions we came to an agreement that we wanted to create a game that was similar
          to Super Mario in terms of it being a 2d side scroller game. The main idea of the game came from a game with a very similar game concept called Cat mario. The game starts the character (cat) in the very first map of super mario.
          Assuming that the player has played that map previously, they will try to traverse through it as normal, but every part of the game has some kind of hidden traps designed to kill the player in very annoying ways.</p>
        <h1 class="display-4 sm-spacer" id="about-me">Themes</h1>
        <p class="sm-spacer md-font">The game follows a farmer that wakes up after being kidnapped by his sheep. He finds himself in an unfamiliar section of his farm
          where he is forced to find his way back home. What he doesn't know is that his sheep have plotting revenge against him, which will force him to face a series of
           traps and obstacles designed to kill him. So far, I think our project has been meeting the absurd part of the game pretty well since it has hidden traps and other mechanics that may seem intuitive for any other game,
           but where in ours it will punish you. </p>

        <h1 class="display-4 sm-spacer" id="about-me">Purpose</h1>
        <p class="sm-spacer md-font">The overall purpose of our game is creating a game interface that has the perfect balance between challenging yet, addicting.
          This is so that the player is faced with a difficult game that will take time and enough. We want to make this game difficult, but not enough so that the players
           get frustrated enough to give up and no longer want to play the game. The design of our game follows a basic formula in which following logic and doing things the
           way they should will end up punishing the player by either triggering traps, or other mechanics that will attempt to kill the player.</p>
        <h1 class="display-4 sm-spacer" id="about-me">Project Goals</h1>
        <h3 class="sm-spacer">Game Mechanics: </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Sheep Attack: Sheep suddenly appears and instantly kills the farmer.</li>
          <li>Falling floor</li>
          <li>Rolling hay bale</li>
          <li>Pitch fork trap</li>
          <li>Jumping Cow</li>
          <li>Falling Bird</li>
          <li>Invisible Objects</li>
          <li>Setting checkpoints</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="sm-spacer">Stage :</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Farm</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="sm-spacer">Game Rules :</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>If a players die before a checkpoint, they start from the begining</li>
          <li>If a player dies after a checkpoint, they start from the checkpoint</li>
          <li>If a player hits an enemy, they die</li>
          <li>If the player falls from the map, they die</li>
          <li>Background doesn't scroll to the left (Prevents the player from going back)</li>
          <li>If the player finds the hidden end goal, the game will end.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1 class="display-4 sm-spacer" id="about-me">Reflection</h1>
        <p class="sm-spacer md-font">Some of the obstacles we've faced are that we all barely know how program using unity's most common language C# so it takes quite a while for the objects to act in a way we would
           want to because we would have to watch multiple tutorials and combine what we picked up on it since most video does not give us a perfect code for our absurd trap behavior. We dealt with it by splitting
            roles on which traps we will make so that one people will not have to do all the coding. I think our team has been working pretty well together, and we've been able to meet a lot of the goals and
            mechanics that we wanted to add to our game. In terms of our time management we've done very and we are ahead of our planned schedule which will hopefully give us more time to refine the graphics
             and make the overall game feel more smooth.</p>
