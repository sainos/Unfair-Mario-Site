          <p class="name-font sm-spacer">Update #1</p><p class="status-cap stat-font">For our first status update we worked on a variety of different things.
            We came to a compromise in which Ty and Shio would help on the design of the website through the use of wix, and Eduardo would port the changes into the actual site by coding it.
            The team created a platform (website) in which we will be able to give detailed information about the team, our game, and the progress of the game.
            The layout of the site is basically finished, but the design needs a bit more work, but everything was templatized to make things a lot easier for us later on.
            The updates of the website should be fairly easy since everything has been templatized, so all that will be needed is to replace image urls as well as just replacing
            the text with something different. We also worked on creating a brief low fidelity prototype to throw ideas of the game mechanics, and the feel and aesthetics of the game.

          <p class="name-font lg-spacer" style="padding-top:30px">Update #2</p><p class="status-cap stat-font" style="margin-bottom:0px">For our second status update we worked on creating more low fidelity prototypes
            for the layout of the map and how we wanted everything to flow. We also discussed the types of traps we wanted and how we were going to be distributing the work. In terms
            of the current state of the game we are almost finished with everything. We all worked on coding the different mechanics of the traps and the player controls, and we have
            laid out the whole map of the game. Ty worked on creating the very first design of the map in Unity and he also created the assets that we needed for the sheep enemies, as well
            as some of the map assets and the character model. All that is needed for our game is just very small changes for polishing purposes, but everything is complete. We are ahead
            of our projected timeline, so we have more time to work on the final document.
